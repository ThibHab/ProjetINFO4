# LICENSE PERMISSIONS

A few panel graphics have uncertain license terms when it comes to redistribution and usage within Cardinal.
Cardinal authors have requested permission to the creators/owners of such graphics, for use and redistribution of the same.

This document gives details on such licenses where there is no online resource to directly link to (permission request happened via private chat or email).
Below follows a direct copy and paste of each individual request.

For most projects that is not an issue, but with the Befaco modules we'd like to resolve a couple things. One is that in the VCV repo it says `used and distributed with permission`, but even though we directly use the source repository we mean to assume this permission is given to VCV explicitly. We would like to know if you would allow us to use these same panels, unmodified, in our project.

### Light Panels

> I have another panel-question for you. Filipe has been working on a (silly) feature for Cardinal that brings "real light mode" to all the panels. This is something we have been doing for "dark mode" already. This was not applicable to Befaco panels of course, since they are already dark. However now it will be possible to also flip a switch and turn all panels to "light".
