## code

This project is a rolling thing, I learn and make up things as I go, so coherent structure or easily reusable stuff may not be something you will find here.

No money? No problem! You can still help by doing any of the following :

- report bugs
- improve the manual by telling me if something is unclear
- make videos using my modules, be it music or tutorials (please do this!)
- talk about my modules to strangers and your pet
- enjoy spending time with or without my modules

I collect videos featuring my stuff [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFSNCbgM5oPYaIHDeDTUhBoRFzkfhK6vd)

If you have anything to add to that list, need help or want to discuss ideas, feel free to [reach out](https://community.vcvrack.com/u/unlessgames)!

## licensing

Most of the source code is free to use, but I reserve my rights to the visual identity of my modules. 
In general, I don't want others to put my free modules behind pay-walls or make it seem like I have ported them to some other environment.

If you have something in mind that goes against these licenses, contact me, I'm willing to make exceptions!
