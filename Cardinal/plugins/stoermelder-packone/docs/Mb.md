## Tips

- Hidden modules can be shown again by hotkey CTRL+Space.

- Hitting the Space-key will toggle the _Favorites_ category.

- Favorites and hidden modules are stored in your local Rack-directory. You can share them or copy them to another computer by MB's export/import function on the context menu.

- For _v1 mod_, by context menu option the "brands"-section can be hidden (added in v1.9.0).

- For _v1 mod_, By context memu option also the modules' description can be searched (added in v1.9.0).
