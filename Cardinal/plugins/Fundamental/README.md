# Fundamental (alternative panel design)

The Fundamental plugin pack gives you a basic foundation to create simple synthesizers,
route and analyze signals, complement other more complicated modules,
and build some not-so-simple patches using brute force (lots of modules).
They are also a great reference for creating your own plugins in C++.

This repository contains a fork of [VCV Fundamental](https://github.com/VCVRack/Fundamental) with an alternative panel design.

Contrary to the original VCV project, pull requests for changes, fixes etc are welcome!
Just note that compatibility with the original is required, though it only needs to be one way (from original to fork).
