## Polynucleus

![Polynucleus](images/polynucleus.png)

Polynucleus is an alternative version of [Nucleus](Nucleus.md),
only with individual 3-channel polyphonic ports for input and output,
rather than triplets of monophonic ports.

Polynucleus is intended to be more convenient for workflows
oriented toward vectors and matrices.

The blank panel space in the lower left corner is reserved for
additional controls/inputs that are not yet ready for release.
In a future release, additional controls/inputs will be added here.
Any changes new enhancements will default to identical
behavior with the current version of Polynucleus, to avoid
unintentional changes to existing patches.
