### Binary Gate
This is a very simple module with a single gate output. There are three gate inputs with corresponding buttons. The first two buttons turn the output gate on or off, while the third toggles its current state.

Patch ideas:
- Connect MIDI note gates to the gate inputs. Use your MIDI keyboard to launch and stop other sequencers with Binary Gate's main output.
