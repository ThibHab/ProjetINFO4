### Rotator
This module was inspired by the [4ms Rotating Clock Divider](http://www.4mspedals.com/rcd.php). Unlike the RCD, this takes up to eight arbitrary inputs and rotates them around the eight outputs. The STAGES control determines how many inputs are used (and repeated), while the ROTATE control is what determines their output positions.

Patch Ideas:
- This module thrives at jumbling gate signals and creating odd rhythms. Try connecting multiple Boolean Logic outputs to the inputs, along with various other clock sources. Modulate the ROTATE parameter with an LFO. For more predictable results, use an LFO that is running at the same speed as one of the clocks.
