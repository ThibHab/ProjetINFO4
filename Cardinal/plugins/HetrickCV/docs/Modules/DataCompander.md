### Data Compander
Not to be confused with a dynamics compander, this module is based on mu-law (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9C-law_algorithm) and A-law (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-law_algorithm) compansion. These algorithms were used to reduce noise on transmitted signals. Here you can mix-and-match which laws are active along with their expected voltage ranges.
