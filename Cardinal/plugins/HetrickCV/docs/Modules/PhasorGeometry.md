# Phasor Geometry

This utility converts a phasor into five useful variations.

Reverse: This is equivalent to (10V - Input Phasor). If the input phasor is ascending, the output is descending. The opposite is also true.

Ping Pong: Converts the incoming phasor to a triangle, so half the phasor is ascending, and half the phasor is descending.

Pong Ping: Same as Ping Pong, but flipped.

x2/x4: Outputs two or four phasor cycles for every one input cycle.
