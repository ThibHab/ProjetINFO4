VCV Rack is [open-source](https://opensource.org/osd) and [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) but not open-contribution.
VCV is unable to accept outside code contributions to Rack itself.

However there are several ways you can be involved in the Rack project.
- Answer questions in the [VCV communities](https://vcvrack.com/manual/Communities).
- [Develop your own Rack plugin](https://vcvrack.com/manual/PluginDevelopmentTutorial), or help maintain an existing plugin.
- Apply for a [job at VCV](https://vcvrack.com/jobs).
